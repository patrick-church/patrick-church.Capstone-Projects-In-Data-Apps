    <h2>Automated Cross-Validation for LWR and Random Forest</h2>

    <p>My code displays a class that implements a Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), a regression technique that emphasizes local data points when making predictions. It also offers the option to compare this method with Random Forest by switching the model type.</p>

    <p>The cross_validate function in the class incorporates all the other functions from the class for optimal automation. It brings together the fit, predict, mse, and r2_score functions to automate the K-fold cross-validation for Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) and Random Forest.</p>

    <h3>Kernel Functions</h3>
    <p>Before we get into the functions within the class, there are four kernel functions outside of the class that help create the weights for LWR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaussian</li>
        <li>Tricubic</li>
        <li>Epanechnikov</li>
        <li>Quartic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The different kernel functions allow the user to test and choose the most accurate one.</p>
