    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment, I will explore and compare different oversampling methods on the widely-used Porto Seguro Insurance dataset to address class imbalance. 
        I will demonstrate the use of several techniques, including SMOTE, ADASYN, FastKDE, and Normalizing Flows, to generate synthetic samples for the minority 
        class. Each method takes a unique approach to balancing the dataset, from interpolative sampling to density estimation and generative modeling. 
        By applying these methods, I aim to improve the model's ability to accurately identify minority class instances and provide a comparative analysis 
        of the effectiveness of each approach.
